# Customer app (placeholder)

This folder is reserved for the Customer Flutter app.

If you already have a customer app, place its project here (pubspec.yaml, lib/, android/, ios/, web/...).

To scaffold a new Flutter app in this folder:

```powershell
cd client
flutter create customer
cd customer
flutter pub get
```

Then adapt UI/screens from the restaurant app as needed.
